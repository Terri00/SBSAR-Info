# SBSAR-Info
Gets some information from Substance Archive files in C#, an alternative to the Allegorithmic python/cmd interface. 

It is getting the info by itself, by decompressing and extracting the .xml files inside the archive. Meaning you don't need the python library to write tools in C#.

## Example:
Included in Program.cs is a small example program to output some information about the archive file on args[0]

## Note:
This hasn't been tested with many archives and may be prone to failing.

More features to come.
